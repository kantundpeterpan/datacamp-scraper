    "In my last two posts ([here](/building-a-datacamp-archive/) and [here](/webscraping-datacamp-courses-ii/)), I discussed my efforts to scrape the [DataCamp](http://datacamp.com/) website so that I could have a record of the courses I've taken. In this final post, I'm putting all the pieces together, discussing how the script works and showing what the final product looks like. \n",

    "There's a lot of code here, so I've frontloaded it into the first half of the post. You can choose your own adventure. If you're interested in how the script works, go to the next section. If you're interested in seeing what the script does, skip to the section \"In Action.\"\n",

    "Before I dive in, I want to say how excited I am about this project. A year ago, I could barely print `\"Hello world\"`, but thanks to sites like [DataCamp](http://datacamp.com/), communities like [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) and a heavy dose of [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), I'm doing things like this. So if you're interested in coding or data science but think its something you could never do, think again. Keep a growth mindset, and dive  in.\n",

    "# How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the script works. The user passes the link of the course they want to `get_whole_course()`. This function then uses `get_course_outline()` to get a list of the chapters and lessons in each course, `make_chapter_notes()` to create a text file for each chapter, and `download_chapter_slides()` to download a PDF of the chapter slides. It then creates a text file with a table of contents for each course. This allows for easy navegation of the course once all the text files are in my notes system (I use [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) and [The Archive](http://zettelkasten.de)). Everything is organized using unqiue, 14-digit \"z numbers,\" which are assigned to each course and chapter.\n",
